Introduction :

News media has become a channel to pass on the information of what’s happening in the world to the people living. Often people perceive whatever conveyed in the news to be true. There were circumstances where even the news channels acknowledged that their news is not true as they wrote.

One news can shift the curves up and down depending on the emotions of people and political situation.
